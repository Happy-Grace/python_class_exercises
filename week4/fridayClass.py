# Write a program to create two dictionary objects named 'states' and 'cities'


states = {
    "Oregon": "OR",
    "Florida": "FL",
    "California": "CA",
    "New York": "NY",
    "Michigan": "MI"
}

cities = {
    "CA": "San Francisco",
    "MI": "Detroit",
    "FL": "Jacksonville"
}

cities["NY"] = "New York"
cities["OR"] = "Portland"

print(f"{states["New York"]} has a city called: {cities["NY"]}")
print(f"{states["Oregon"]} has a city called: {cities["OR"]}")
print("")

# for i in states.keys():
#     print(f"{i}, {states[i]}")


##### TRY FIXING/SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS...
# for states, abbr in  states.items():
#     print("%s is abbreviated %s ." %states %abbr)
